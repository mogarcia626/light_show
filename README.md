## Technologies
- Javascript
- HTML
- HTML's Canvas
- SCSS

## Backdrop
The user can select from a list of provided backdrops.  The backdrops were animated using HTML's Canvas feature.  The location backdrops are programmed to give a 3D effect, where fireworks launch from higher up on the canvas are smaller.


## Fireworks
Fireworks were developed using Object Oriented Programming.  Each firework is an object within a projectile class with different behaviors. The colors location and movement direction of each firework are randomly generated. Each Firework object has a gravity, acceleration, velocity, and position vector mimicking real-life gravitational principles.


## Customization
The user can open a menu that allows him to select which colors of the fireworks display.


## Launching on Click
Clicking anywhere on the canvas will launch a firework from that location.
